Hey! I'm on a mission to learn react. I'll be posting series of mini react projects likes this regularly.


# Movie-WatchList-App.
This is a react app that allows a user to add a movie from lists of movies to watched archive and also allows a user to add a movie from list of movies to watchlist archive.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads "Download Git") must be installed on your operating system.

## Installing

To install, follow these steps:

Linux and macOS:

```bash
sudo git clone https://github.com/chukshon/React-mini-project-basic-review-app.git
```

Windows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chukshon/React-mini-project-basic-review-app.git
```


After creation, your project should look like this:

```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
This command installs a package and any packages that it depends on. If the package has a package-lock

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
